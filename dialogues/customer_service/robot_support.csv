Agent: Task motion profiles require precise programming and motion planning. Review the program's code and ensure the motion profiles are correctly configured. If the arm still struggles, we'll help you optimize task motion profiles."
97,97,Robotic arm control lag during remote operation,"Customer: The robotic arm experiences control lag during remote operation, making precise movements challenging. Agent: Control lag might be related to network latency or communication issues. Check the network connection and bandwidth. If control lag persists, we'll assist you in optimizing the remote operation for smoother control."
98,98,Failure to identify specific object features,"Customer: The robotic arm struggles to identify specific object features, causing handling errors. Agent: Object feature recognition relies on sensor calibration and accurate algorithms. Calibrate the sensors and adjust the recognition algorithms as needed. If the arm still struggles, we'll assist you in enhancing object feature identification."
99,99,Unexpected error messages during operation,"Customer: The robotic arm displays unexpected error messages during operation, leading to stoppages. Agent: Unexpected error messages can be challenging to diagnose. Review the system logs for detailed error information and inspect the control system's behavior. If the cause remains unclear, we'll assist you in resolving the error messages."
100,100,Inability to perform tasks in low light conditions,"Customer: The robotic arm struggles to perform tasks in low light conditions, affecting its operation during nighttime. Agent: Low light conditions might impair sensor performance and object detection. Consider using additional lighting or upgrading the sensors for low light capabilities. We'll assist you in optimizing performance in low light conditions."
