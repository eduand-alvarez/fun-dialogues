## How to Contribute
If you want to contribute to this project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

### Contributing your own Lifecycle Solution
If you want to contribute to an existing dialogue or add a new dialogue, please open an issue and I will follow up with you ASAP!

### Implementing Patches and Bug Fixes

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
- Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the component has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!

If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code – not what you did to the code.

The dialogues contained in this repository are provided for experimental purposes only. It is important to note that these dialogues are assumed to be original work by a human and are entirely fictitious, despite the possibility of some examples including factually correct information. The primary intention behind these dialogues is to serve as a tool for language modeling experimentation and should not be used for designing real-world products beyond non-production prototyping.

Please be aware that the utilization of fictitious data in these datasets may increase the likelihood of language model artifacts, such as hallucinations or unrealistic responses. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution and discretion when employing these datasets for any purpose.

It is crucial to emphasize that none of the scenarios described in the fun dialogues dataset should be relied upon to provide advice or guidance to humans. These scenarios are purely fictitious and are intended solely for demonstration purposes. Any resemblance to real-world situations or individuals is entirely coincidental.
